# Banking Network System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Computer Networks** course to design and implement a secure and reliable network infrastructure for a banking institution. The system ensures seamless communication between various departments, supports secure online transactions, and integrates essential services such as customer support.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To create a network that:
- Supports **real-time transactions** and **remote access**
- Maintains **high security** across multiple branches and departments
- Enables **efficient communication** between different departments
- Allows **easy network management** with minimal manual intervention

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### **1. Network Design & Topology**
- Designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer** with a **structured topology**.
- Departments were separated into **VLANs** and subnets for isolation and security.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** was used as the core routing protocol for efficient packet routing.

### **2. Security Measures**
- **HTTPS** for secure communication.
- **SSH** for secure remote access to routers.
- VLAN segmentation to prevent unauthorized access between departments.
- **WPA2/WPA3** protocols for securing wireless networks.

### **3. Dynamic IP Addressing**
- **DHCP** servers assigned IP addresses dynamically to simplify management.

### **4. Wireless Network Integration**
- Wireless Access Points (WAPs) deployed in each department for complete coverage.
- Wireless networks secured with strong encryption.

### **5. Servers & Services**
- **HTTP** and **Email servers** implemented for customer services and internal communications.

### **6. Network Performance Monitoring**
- Tools used to measure **bandwidth, latency, and packet loss**.
- Proactive monitoring improved uptime and issue resolution speed.
